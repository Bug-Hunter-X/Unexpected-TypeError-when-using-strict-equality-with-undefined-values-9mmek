# Unexpected TypeError when using strict equality with undefined values

This code demonstrates a common error in JavaScript when using strict equality (===) with undefined values.  The function `foo` attempts to check for null values, but fails to handle undefined values appropriately, resulting in a TypeError.

The solution involves explicitly checking for both null and undefined values, or using a more robust approach, to prevent the error.
